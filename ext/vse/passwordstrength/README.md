# ![Password Strength](http://mattfriedman.me/forum/images/showpass.png "Password Strength") Password Strength

## Demo
Try it out yourself here: ([Online Demo](http://vsephpbb.github.io/passwordstrength/))

## Features
* Password field changes colors from red (weak) to green (strong) as the user types in a password.
* Password strength is also labeled as 'Very Weak', 'Weak', 'Good', 'Strong' or 'Very Strong'.
* Password Strength is active on new user registration, and in the UCP and ACP areas where you can enter new passwords.
* Password Strength is scored using one of the available algorithms:
    1. __Complexity__ is an unintelligent test that checks for complexity in a password by looking for a mix of characters, case, symbols, numbers and length. This is useful for encouraging hard to remember complex passwords, but can score easily cracked passwords like `P@s$w0rd` as Strong.
    2. __zxcvbn algorithm__ (used by DropBox) is an intelligent algorithm that calculates the guess-ability of a password by comparing it to a large dictionary of common English words as well as looking for recognizable patterns like `P@s$w0rd`. This is a more robust strength checker that allows for user-friendly passwords that are easy to remember but still hard to guess. A Very Strong result represents a password that may take a computer years to centuries to guess.
